Google Map API

What we can get from it:



(1) Searching for places with text, which is useful for calling centre.



(2) Get the lat&lng of a place, either by search or clicking/touching the map.



(3) Mark the map with different icons.



(4) Drawing arbitrary shape on the map using polygons. Examples can be found here.
