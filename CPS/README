CPS
=================

To run CPS, create a new Java Project in Eclipse, and the home directory of the
new project should be the CPS directory in which this README file is located. Do
not use extinguisher's top directory directly as the Eclipse project directory.
Use top(where CPS, IS, OS are located)/CPS as home directory for Eclipse
project.

After the project is created with the correct home directory, the source code
and libraries should be automatically loaded. And you just need to supply
command line argument to Eclipse: Run->Run Configuration-> command line argument
Fill in the following:
wFramework.serviceImpl1.DefaultSystemService cms.config1.DefaultConfigBuilder

Alternatively, you can start running using commandline from CPS/bin/. CPS/bin/
is created by Eclipse automatically when it compiles our source code.

cd CPS/bin
java -classpath .:../libs/* misc.SystemEntry wFramework.serviceImpl1.DefaultSystemService cms.config1.DefaultConfigBuilder

Note that the main function is in the misc package, SystemEntry.java

after that you can click Run, open your browser and enter:
http://localhost:8080/kill
http://localhost:8080/test1
http://localhost:8080/incident
http://localhost:8080/request
http://localhost:8080/reconfig
http://localhost:8080/register
